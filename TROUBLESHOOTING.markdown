Troubleshooting Coppersmith
===========================

### Missing imports
Symptom: Code fails to comile with one of the following messages:
```log
value featureSetBuilder is not a member of commbank.coppersmith.From
value featureSetBuilder is not a member of commbank.coppersmith.Joined
value featureSetBuilder is not a member of commbank.coppersmith.CompleteJoinHlFeatureSource
```
Cause: Missing `Coppersmith._` import. Either:
```scala
import commbank.coppersmith.api.Coppersmith._
```
or
```scala
import commbank.coppersmith.api._, Coppersmith._
```

### Serialisation issues

The functions that make up feature definitions must only refer to fully
serialisable types. Unfortunately it can be easy to accidentally close
over some non-serialisable instance indirectly, especially if using
classes that are nested within another class. Doing so will usually
manifest itself at runtime in the form of an exception with a stacktrace
along the lines of:

```
...
Caused by: cascading.flow.planner.PlannerException: could not build flow from assembly: [Neither Java nor Kyro works for class: class com.twitter.scalding.typed.MapFn instance: <function1>
export CHILL_EXTERNALIZER_DEBUG=true to see both stack traces]
...
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Neither Java nor Kyro works for class: class com.twitter.scalding.typed.MapFn instance: <function1>
export CHILL_EXTERNALIZER_DEBUG=true to see both stack traces
...
```

As indicated by the message, if you set the `CHILL_EXTERNALIZER_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` and run the job again, you will receive more information about the unserialisable instance, eg:

```
com.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
Serialization trace:

g$1 (com.twitter.scalding.typed.TypedPipe$$anonfun$groupBy$1)
fn (com.twitter.scalding.typed.MapFn)
fmap (com.twitter.scalding.typed.MapFn)
```

Working from the bottom of the serialisation trace up should reveal the
type at the edge of the feature definition code that is causing the
problem (`ScaldingJobSpec.AggregationFeatures` in the above example).

In the case of a nested class that is implicitly carrying a reference to
its outer instance, it is usually sufficient to make the nested class a
top level class instead. In the case of classes that have
non-serialisable fields, making them lazy if possible or marking
them as transient can also fix the problem. More information can be
found in [this scalding FAQ](https://github.com/twitter/scalding/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#q-im-getting-a-notserializableexception-on-hadoop-job-submission).


### Empty output

If the job runs successfully, but the expected features are not generated,
some common causes to consider include:

* Incorrect path to source data (misconfigured `FeatureSource` bindings)
* Incorrect join or filter conditions

Coppersmith produces diagnostic logging that can help identify these problems.

Firstly, both the `HiveTextSource` and `HiveParquetSource`
implementations will log the absolute path from which data is loaded, e.g.:

```
INFO  commbank.coppersmith.scalding.HiveParquetSource  - Loading '|' delimited text from /path/to/data
```

Secondly, the "Coppersmith counters" logged at the end of the job
show the number of records read from each data source, and also the
number of rows remaining after joining each table.
For example, the `DirectorsFeaturesJob` from the user guide logs:

```
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats: Coppersmith counters:
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.typedpipe                    2465882
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.text                            1682
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     join.level1                          1023
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.text                          100000
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     join.level2                         67145
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     write.text                            732
```

Just be aware that counters with zero counts are *omitted* from the log.
So, if you are joining three tables (as above), but only see this:

```
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats: Coppersmith counters:
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.typedpipe                    2465882
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.text                            1682
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     join.level1                          1023
INFO commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats:     load.text                          100000
```

Then it could indicate that `join.level2` is zero,
i.e. no records remain after joining the third table.

**NOTE: The reliability of Coppersmith counters is not well understood,
and they should not be used when accurate record counts are required.**
They are only intended for diagnosing large problems and trends,
and in the case of minor discrepancies ("14 records are missing!")
the data on disk should be treated as the only authorative source of statistics.

You may need to explicitly enable logging in order to see the log messages.
For example, to see these logs when running Thermometer tests,
create a file called `src/test/resources/log4j.properties` containing:

```properties
log4j.rootLogger=ERROR,stdout

log4j.logger.commbank.coppersmith.scalding.HiveTextSource=INFO
log4j.logger.commbank.coppersmith.scalding.HiveParquetSource=INFO
log4j.logger.commbank.coppersmith.scalding.CoppersmithStats=INFO

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %c %x - %m%n
```
